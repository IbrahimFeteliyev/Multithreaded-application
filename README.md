There are three threads (producers threads) that put items into a set (a collection of unsorted items
that can occur only once in the collection) and two threads (consumer threads) that extract items from
the set (you have to choose a random object from the set to extract). Develop a multithreaded application
that organizes their concurrent work. Pay special attention to synchronization issues! c++
